Partially NSFW:
- [dafont.com](https://www.dafont.com/) - A great place to find all kinds of fancy fonts, including many rare pixel fonts. Lets you enter preview text to get a feel for the font before downloading it. Some of the fonts contain themes considered too edgy for general public.
- [deviantart.com](https://www.deviantart.com/) - A great place to find photoshop/gimp brushes, textures, icons, ui design inspiration, signature tutorials, and more. I strongly recomend looking up `abstract brushes`, and `grundge brushes`, they are really neat. Some of the content on deviantart contains themes considered too edgy for general public.
